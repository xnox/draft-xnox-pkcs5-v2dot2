1.  Introduction

   This document provides recommendations for the implementation of
   password-based cryptography, covering the following aspects:

   *  key derivation functions

   *  encryption schemes

   *  message authentication schemes

   *  ASN.1 syntax identifying the techniques

   The recommendations are intended for general application within
   computer and communications systems and, as such, include a fair
   amount of flexibility.  They are particularly intended for the
   protection of sensitive information such as private keys as in CMS
   [RFC5652] and Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958].  It is expected that
   application standards and implementation profiles based on these
   specifications may include additional constraints.

   Other cryptographic techniques based on passwords, such as password-
   based key entity authentication and key establishment protocols are
   outside the scope of this document.

   The password-based key derivation functions described in this
   document are not memory-hard and do not offer protection against
   attacks using custom hardware.  If possible, consider using scrypt
   [RFC7914] or Argon2 [RFC9106] instead.

   Guidelines for the selection of passwords are also outside the scope.
   This document supersedes PKCS #5 version 2.1 [RFC8018] and removes
   techniques it has previouslly obsoleted.

4.  Overview

   In many applications of public-key cryptography, user security is
   ultimately dependent on one or more secret text values or passwords.
   Since a password is not directly applicable as a key to any
   conventional cryptosystem, however, some processing of the password
   is required to perform cryptographic operations with it.  Moreover,
   as passwords are often chosen from a relatively small space, special
   care is required in that processing to defend against search attacks.

   A general approach to password-based cryptography, as described by
   Morris and Thompson [MORRIS] for the protection of password tables,
   is to combine a password with a salt to produce a key.  The salt can
   be viewed as an index into a large set of keys derived from the
   password and need not be kept secret.  Although it may be possible
   for an opponent to construct a table of possible passwords (a so-
   called "dictionary attack"), constructing a table of possible keys
   will be difficult, since there will be many possible keys for each
   password.  An opponent will thus be limited to searching through
   passwords separately for each salt.

   Another approach to password-based cryptography is to construct key
   derivation techniques that are relatively expensive, thereby
   increasing the cost of exhaustive search.  One way to do this is to
   include an iteration count in the key derivation technique,
   indicating how many times to iterate some underlying function by
   which keys are derived.  A modest number of iterations (say, 1000) is
   not likely to be a burden for legitimate parties when computing a
   key, but also trivial to attack with custom hardware.

   Whenever possible, please switch from functions described here to
   memory-hard function such as scrypt [RFC7914] or Argon2 [RFC9106]
   instead.

   Salt and iteration count formed the basis for password-based
   encryption in PKCS #5 v2.0, and are adopted here as well for the
   various cryptographic operations.  Thus, password-based key
   derivation as defined here is a function of a password, a salt, and
   an iteration count, where the latter two quantities need not be kept
   secret.

   From a password-based key derivation function, it is straightforward
   to define password-based encryption and message authentication
   schemes.  As in PKCS #5 v2.0, the password-based encryption schemes
   here are based on an underlying, conventional encryption scheme,
   where the key for the conventional scheme is derived from the
   password.  Similarly, the password-based message authentication
   scheme is based on an underlying conventional scheme.  This two-
   layered approach makes the password-based techniques modular in terms
   of the underlying techniques they can be based on.

   It is expected that the password-based key derivation functions may
   find other applications than just the encryption and message
   authentication schemes defined here.  For instance, one might use the
   output produced by key derivation function described here as the
   keying material input to HKDF [RFC5869].  Another application is
   password checking, where the output of the key derivation function is
   stored (along with the salt and iteration count) for the purposes of
   subsequent verification of a password.

   Throughout this document, a password is considered to be an octet
   string of arbitrary length whose interpretation as a text string is
   unspecified.  In the interest of interoperability, however, it is
   recommended that applications follow some common text encoding rules.
   ASCII and UTF-8 [RFC3629] are two possibilities.  (ASCII is a subset
   of UTF-8.)

   Although the selection of passwords is outside the scope of this
   document, guidelines have been published [SP800-63b] that may well be
   taken into account.

5.  Salt and Iteration Count

   Inasmuch as salt and iteration count are central to the techniques
   defined in this document, some further discussion is warranted.

5.1.  Salt

   A salt in password-based cryptography has traditionally served the
   purpose of producing a large set of keys corresponding to a given
   password, one of which is selected at random according to the salt.
   An individual key in the set is selected by applying a key derivation
   function KDF, as

                          DK = KDF (P, S)

   where DK is the derived key, P is the password, and S is the salt.
   This has two benefits:

   1.  It is difficult for an opponent to precompute all the keys, or
       even the most likely keys, corresponding to a dictionary of
       passwords.  If the salt is 128 bits long, for instance, there
       will be as many as 2^128 keys for each password.  An opponent is
       thus limited to searching for passwords after a password- based
       operation has been performed and the salt is known.

   2.  It is unlikely that the same key will be selected twice.  Again,
       if the salt is 128 bits long, the chance of "collision" between
       keys does not become significant until about 2^64 keys have been
       produced, according to the Birthday Paradox.  The fact that
       collisions are unlikely addresses some concerns about
       interactions between multiple uses of the same key that may arise
       when using some encryption and authentication techniques.

   In password-based encryption, the party encrypting a message can gain
   assurance that these benefits are realized simply by selecting a
   large and sufficiently random salt when deriving an encryption key
   from a password.  A party generating a message authentication code
   can gain such assurance in a similar fashion.

   The party decrypting a message or verifying a message authentication
   code, however, cannot be sure that a salt supplied by another party
   has actually been generated at random.  It is possible, for instance,
   that the salt may have been copied from another password-based
   operation in an attempt to exploit interactions between multiple uses
   of the same key.  For instance, suppose two legitimate parties
   exchange an encrypted message, where the encryption key is an 160-bit
   key derived from a shared password with some salt.  An opponent could
   take the salt from that encryption and provide it to one of the
   parties as though it were for a 40-bit key.  If the party reveals the
   result of decryption with the 40-bit key, the opponent may be able to
   solve for the 40-bit key.  In the case that 40-bit key is the first
   half of the 80-bit key, the opponent can then readily solve for the
   remaining 40 bits of the 80-bit key.

   To defend against such attacks, avoid multiple uses of the same key.
   The salt must not contain data that explicitly distinguishes between
   different operations.  For example, the salt must not have an
   additional, non-random octet that specifies whether the derived key
   is for encryption, for message authentication, or for some other
   operation.

   Based on this, the following is recommended for salt generation:

   1.  The salt must be generated at random and need not be checked for
       a particular format by the party receiving the salt.  It should
       be at least sixteen octets (128 bits) long.

   2.  The salt must not contain any data that explicitly distinguishes
       between different operations, customization string and different
       key lengths.

   3.  The encoding of a structure that specifies detailed information
       about the derived key, such as the encryption or authentication
       technique, customization string and a sequence number among the
       different keys derived from the password.  The particular format
       of the additional data is left to the application.

   If a random number generator or pseudorandom generator is not
   available, a deterministic alternative for generating the salt must
   not be made available.

5.2.  Iteration Count

   An iteration count has traditionally served the purpose of increasing
   the cost of producing keys from a password, thereby also increasing
   the difficulty of attack.  Mathematically, an iteration count of c
   will increase the security strength of a password by log2(c) bits
   against trial-based attacks like brute force or dictionary attacks.

   Choosing a reasonable value for the iteration count depends on
   environment and circumstances, and varies from application to
   application.  The computing power of general purpose and bespoke
   hardware has significantly increased in its hashing performance.
   This has been demonstrated by the hashcat [HASHCAT] software.

   This document broadly follows the OWASP Foundation [OWASP-PASSWORD]
   recommendations:

   *  PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512: 210,000 iterations (recommended by this
      document)

   *  PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: 600,000 iterations

   The NIST SP 800-63b [SP800-63b] recommends password of minimum 8
   characters length and calls for support of maximum 64 characters
   length.  Given UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded characters can be up to 4
   bytes long, the block size of 512 bits can be often reached by the
   password.  When block size is exceeded it will result in pre-hashing
   the password string to reduce its size, leading to what is known as
   PBKDF2 hash collision [PBKDF2COLLISION].  To avoid such collisions
   this document recommends to choose PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 with 210,000
   iterations count due to its larger block size and wide support.
